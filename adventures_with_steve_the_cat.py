Notes:

Flags:
living_room_first = None  --> stores whether or not user is choose living or dining room
found_toy = False --> let us know if the toy has been found (true = yes, falso = no)

While Loop:
ensure users put in valid response
living_room_first = True --> runs through the living room loop
living_room_first = False --> jumps to dining room loop
